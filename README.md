# 💻 C++ Homework Collection

Welcome to my C++ homework archive! This repository contains several assignments organized by homework number (`1_`, `2_`, `3_`, etc.). 
Each group demonstrates problem-solving, logic, and programming skills using fundamental and intermediate C++ features.

## 🧩 Homework 1 – Palindromes & Number Guessing

### 📄 Files
- `1_1_A_HW.cpp` – Check if an input number is a palindrome.
- `1_1_B_HW.cpp` – Generate all 6-digit palindromic numbers in the form ABC CBA.
- `1_2_HW.cpp` – Random number guessing game (user guesses).
- `1_3_HW.cpp` – Computer tries to guess your number using binary search logic.

### 🔧 Concepts Used
- Loops and conditionals
- Functions with `const` references
- Random number generation
- Input/output handling
- String processing
- Palindrome logic

## 🧠 Homework 2 – 2D Arrays and Shape Detection

### 📄 Files
- `2_1_HW.cpp` – Generate an NxN matrix of random numbers (10–99) and rotate it by 90° clockwise.
- `2_2_HW.cpp` – Detect and compute the area of the largest "shape" (connected 1s) in a 2D binary grid using flood fill (BFS).

### 🔧 Concepts Used
- 2D array traversal
- Matrix transformation
- Recursion and queue-based search (BFS)
- Validation and input checking
- Algorithm design for shape detection

## 🎮 Homework 3 – Time Validation & Word Guessing Game

### 📄 Files
- `3_1_HW.cpp` – Validates a time string input against format `hh:mm:ss` and logical time rules.
- `3_2_HW.cpp` (split into `MAIN`, `HEADER`, and `HPP` files) – Implements a word guessing game in Latvian with penalty points, hidden word display, and randomized word selection.

### 🔧 Concepts Used
- String parsing and validation
- `std::stringstream`, `getline`, and `stoi`
- Header files and modular code structure
- Game loop, scoring logic
- Vectors, randomization, character-level input

---

## 📌 Notes
- All files contain Latvian-language inline comments to explain logic and structure.
- Code was developed progressively, so naming reflects original task numbering.
- Some tasks use basic C++ functions (`rand`, `cin`, `cout`) while others apply more advanced techniques (e.g., header modularity, matrix manipulation, or game logic).
