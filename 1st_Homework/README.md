# 🧠 First Homework – C++ Practice Tasks

This folder contains four introductory C++ tasks focused on logic, palindromes, and number guessing. These programs demonstrate basic input/output, conditions, loops, functions, and user interaction in the C++ language.

---

## 🧩 1_1_A_HW.cpp – Palindrome Checker
Checks if a user-entered number is a **palindrome** (same forward and backward).

- Example input: `12321`, `45654`, `101101`
- Output: `"12321 is a palindrome!"`
- Logic uses symmetric index comparison in a loop.

---

## 🔢 1_1_B_HW.cpp – Generate 6-digit Palindromes
Generates and displays all **6-digit palindromic numbers** using the format `ABC CBA`.

- No input needed.
- Loops through 3-digit numbers and reverses them.
- Calculates total number of palindromes (900 total).

---

## 🎯 1_2_HW.cpp – Number Guessing Game
Simple number guessing game where the program randomly picks a number between **0–100** and the user has 10 attempts to guess it.

- Gives feedback whether the guess is too low or too high.
- Ends if number is guessed or attempts run out.

---

## 🤖 1_3_HW.cpp – Reverse Number Guesser
Computer tries to guess a number **you think of**, using binary search logic in 10 tries.

- User gives feedback: `+` (too low), `-` (too high), `w` (correct).
- If not guessed in 10 attempts, program ends.

---

## 🛠️ Features Used
- `cin`, `cout`
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Conditionals (`if`, `else`)
- Functions and parameters
- Character input handling
- Basic math and logic operations

---

### 💡 Tip
Run each program in a C++-friendly IDE or using a terminal compiler like `g++`.
